Task List

Fragment
    The purpose of Fragment is to serve as a container for the other objects in this cdxml document.
    We would like to be able to:
        -add a Node, Bond, Arrow
        -keep the id numbers of these objects distinct and consistent
        -probably we want to be able to remove objects too, but this is not strictly necessary right now
        -obtain the cdxml string of a Fragment
